# Self use proxy resource repository-PCR

- Clash is no longer updated and does not support new rules and encryption, so this self use repository is created.
- This repository will consolidate some rules together for ease of use.
- [Clash.Meta](https://github.com/LaolunsiG/PCR/tree/main/Rules/Clash.Meta) can be used for Clash for Android (3.0.3) and Clash for Windows with older Clash kernels.
- This repository is primarily intended for personal storage and use.
